<p>When someone hurts their arm or shoulder badly, it is important to hold the 
injury still using a sling. Instructions detailing how to put a sling on a patient 
are given below.</p>

<ol>
  <li> Before applying a sling, check for cuts and make sure any 
bleeding has stopped.</li>
  <li>For forearm slings, use padding for the injured arm and tie the 
sling around the patient’s neck on the uninjured side.</li>
  <li> For shoulder or collarbone slings, drape the long side of the 
bandage down from the shoulder on the uninjured side, bring it 
over your patient’s arm and tie it behind their back.</li>
<li>Make sure the sling keeps your patient’s arm in place but is not 
so tight that it limits blood flow.</li>
<li> If there is severe bleeding or if you suspect a dislocated joint or 
broken bone, see a doctor immediately. </li>
</ol>
